â€‹In this question our approach is to think in the reverse fashion rather starting from a string full of '?' we rather start from the target string and then we remove the available instances of stamp from it, in the first iteration we look for the entire string (say abc) then we look for ab*,*bc,**c,a**,*b*... in this order (starting with having the least number of stars), this way we are able to get which all indices were actually included to make the target, on completing the sequence we again start the same iteration until we don't get any addition in any of the iterations, now the sequence we've obtained is available in reversed fashion as rather than constructing the solution we had taken the solution and destructured it.!
